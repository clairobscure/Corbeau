# Javascrypt
### A website page using javascript to perform various actions related to cryptography :key:
This is a project I'm doing for school, I will be doing it with another person.
Our goal is to create a simple web page where you can encrypt and decrypt text with the Cesar and Vigenere cypher.  :closed_lock_with_key:

It should also feature some tools to help people decrypt text encrypted with the Cesar and Vigenere cypher.
Everything should be done using *Javascript, HTML and CSS*. We are trying to comment the code as much as possible to make it simple to understand;
we are also trying to log a lot of stuff in the console because 1) It's useful for debuging 2) It's pretty neat! :sunglasses:

Please understand that we are only some amateurs and that our code might not be the fastest and just not well written in general.

#### To-do list:
- [x] Make a simple page to encrypt text using Cesar cypher.
- [ ] Make it also possible to encrypt with Vigenere cypher on this same page.
- [ ] Create a tool to perform a frequency analysis on the text.
- [ ] Create a tool to "brute force" the cesar cypher: so show the text decrypted with the 26 keys to see which key is the good one.
- [ ] Create an algorythm who whould detect comonly used words in the english language to find the good key, after they have all been decrypted with the 26 different keys before.
- [ ] Create a tool to perform a simple dictionary attack on text encrypted with the Vigenere cypher.
- [ ] Create a nice page who use bootstrap.
- [ ] Translate this whole project in French.

We don't know if we will have the time to do everything on the checklist, but we will try!

#### Licence
We are doing this project under the [The Unlicence](http://unlicense.org/) You are free to do whatever you want with this code.
